## Description
Enhance your winter Spark AR effects with beautiful falling snow. There are two ready-to-use templates: one for a World Effect and second for a Face Filter. The spawned particles are picked at random from the sprite sheet and pushed with constantly changing force which is simulating the wind. Additionally, there is a script for the world effect to fade out snowflakes at the end of their lifetime.

Made by Piotr "Shivek" Szafrański with **Spark AR v102** for **Windows**

No, you don't need any license to use the project, except for any asset noted in the [Credits](#credits), and I don’t give any warranty for the project.
