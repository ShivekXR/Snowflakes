Reselling the project files (original, parts, modified, as a binary file, compiled, etc.) is prohibited unless three conditions are met:
1. You, as the seller, like polar bears.
2. You sell just the project for more than 100$ in one transaction. Yes, 100USD - one hundred United States Dollars.
3. You donate at least 10% of the transaction's price to your local or the closest animal charity or animal non-profit organization. Try to find the one that helps polar bears. If you can't, then please donate an animal shelter.

Fun fact - polar bears have white fur but black skin.
You have to keep this text file <GOOD_DEED.txt> unmodified in the root folder of the project.
